This document describes my setup for a simple home server running GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).
The server is based on Intel NUC hardware and runs DNS server, NFS server, Nextcloud, SOCKS5 over VPN proxy server,
Transmission (over VPN), Git server and some other services (see <<server_overview>> for detailed list).

The document is always updated to reflect the current state of the software. The revision history can be found in changelog <<changelog>>.

The document is hosted via GitHub Pages and the source is available at https://github.com/ovk/silverbox.
