=== Monitoring
To setup basic monitoring of the Docker daemon with Monit,
create the `/etc/monit/conf.d/20-docker` file with the following content:

./etc/monit/conf.d/20-docker
----
check process docker with pidfile /var/run/docker.pid
  if does not exist then alert
  if cpu > 30% for 10 cycles then alert
  if total memory > 300.0 MB for 5 cycles then alert
----

Restart Monit service:

----
sudo systemctl restart monit
----

Check Monit web interface and verify that Docker monitoring is working.
