=== Installation

==== Docker CE
To install Docker CE engine follow the instructions from the docker documentation:
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce.

IMPORTANT: For security reasons, it may be good idea not to add your user to the `docker` group.
Membership in the `docker` group essentially grants user the `root` permissions, without requiring to enter
password for privilege elevation (unlike `sudo`).

[[docker_compose_install]]
==== Docker Compose
Docker Compose <<docker_compose>> is a useful tool for deploying and managing multi-container workloads.

At the moment of writing, the preferred method of installation for Ubuntu was simply grabbing
the latest binary from the GitHub releases page.
The downside is that there won't be any automatic upgrades and newer versions of Docker Compose will
have to be installed manually.

To find the latest Docker Compose version number, visit the GitHub releases page at:
https://github.com/docker/compose/releases.

Next, download the `docker-compose` binary:

----
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/{COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose # <1>
----
<1> Replace `\{COMPOSE_VERSION}` with the actual latest Docker Compose version.

And mark it as executable:

----
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
----

Verify that Docker Compose works by doing:

----
docker-compose version
----

NOTE: If you see an error similar to this:
`error while loading shared libraries: libz.so.1: failed to map segment from shared object`
then remove `noexec` option from the `/tmp` partition.
See <<mounting_tmp_as_tmpfs>> for more details.
