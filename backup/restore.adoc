=== Restore Procedure
The exact restore procedures depend on the type of failure that occurred.

To get files from the cloud, use `rclone` tool or download files manually.

To extract particular backup from the Borg repository use `borg extract` command.

Normally, the restored files can be just copied over lost or damaged files.
