== Transmission
This section describes hot to setup Transmission <<transmission>> BitTorrent client on the server.
Similarly to how SOCKS5 proxy server was deployed (as described in the <<socks5_over_vpn>> section),
the Transmission will be running inside a Docker container together with the OpenVPN,
such that all Transmission traffic will be tunneled though the VPN.
Transmission will be managed using web user interface, that will be exposed outside of the container.

This section assumes that <<socks5_over_vpn>> and <<nfs_server>> sections were completed.
