=== Monitoring
The status of the VPN proxy container is monitored by Monit.

First, create the `/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/container_status.sh` file with the following content:

./usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/container_status.sh
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
STATUS=$(docker inspect --format="{{$2}}. Started: {{.State.StartedAt}}. Restarts: {{.RestartCount}}." "$1")
echo $STATUS
case "$STATUS" in
  "$3"*) exit 0 ;;
  *) exit 1 ;;
esac
----

And mark it as executable:

----
sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/container_status.sh
----

This script checks given Docker container status field and compares it against desired value.

Next, create the `/etc/monit/conf.d/40-docker-vpn-proxy` file with the following content:

./etc/monit/conf.d/40-docker-vpn-proxy
----
check program vpn_proxy with path "/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/container_status.sh vpn-proxy .State.Health.Status healthy"
  if status != 0 for 10 cycles then alert
----

Restart Monit service:

----
sudo systemctl restart monit
----

Check Monit web interface and make sure that VPN proxy monitoring is working.
