=== Monitoring
The status of the DNS updater Systemd service is monitored by Monit.

First, create the `/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/is_systemd_unit_failed.sh` file with the following content:

./usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/is_systemd_unit_failed.sh
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
systemctl show $1 -p ExecMainStartTimestamp --value
systemctl is-failed --quiet $1
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    exit 1
else
    exit 0
fi
----

And mark it as executable:

----
sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/is_systemd_unit_failed.sh
----

This script checks whether the given Systemd unit had failed and prints last time it was executed.

Next, create the `/etc/monit/conf.d/50-dns-updater` file with the following content:

./etc/monit/conf.d/50-dns-updater
----
check program dns_updater with path "/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/is_systemd_unit_failed.sh update-dns-record.service" every 30 cycles
  if status != 0 for 2 cycles then alert
----

Restart Monit service:

----
sudo systemctl restart monit
----

Check Monit web interface and make sure that DNS updater monitoring is working.
