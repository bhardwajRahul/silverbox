=== Monitoring
The DNS server will be monitored with Monit, which should by now be configured.

Create the `/etc/monit/conf.d/30-unbound` file with the following content:

----
check process unbound with pidfile /var/run/unbound.pid
  if does not exist then alert
  if cpu > 10% for 5 cycles then alert
  if total memory > 200.0 MB for 5 cycles then alert
  if failed port 53 type udp protocol dns then alert
  if failed port 53 type tcp protocol dns then alert

check program unbound_stats with path "/usr/sbin/unbound-control stats" every 5 cycles
  if status != 0 then alert
----

This will make Monit to check that Unbound process is running and DNS server is accessible over TCP and UDP
and not consuming suspicious amounts of CPU and RAM.
In addition to that, it will grab the Unbound stats every 5 cycles
(which is 5 minutes, if you set cycle duration to a minute).
The Unbound stats are cleared each time `stats` command is executed, so in this case Monit will essentially
show the stats for the last 5 minutes.

Restart the Monit service:

----
sudo systemctl restart monit
----

Check Monit web interface and make sure that DNS monitoring is working.
