== DNS Server
This section describes how to install and configure a DNS server, which will serve clients on the local network.
Client devices in the LAN will use this DNS server as the default DNS server (can be announced by the DHCP server),
and the DNS server will forward queries securely (using DNS over TLS and DNSSEC) to the DNS server of your choice
(this configuration uses Cloudflare's DNS server).
