=== Summary Email
The summary email is just an email that is delivered automatically at regular intervals (weekly) and contains
some system information.

While there are tools that do similar job (for example _logcheck_ and _logwatch_),
I found them quite obsolete and noisy, with almost no documentation.

==== Email Content Generation
The email content is generated with a script, which is invoked by a Systemd timer.
Here is a working example of such script (modify it to suit your needs):

./usr/local/sbin/system-summary.sh
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    PERIOD="week"
else
    PERIOD="$1"
fi

case $PERIOD in
    day | week | month)
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown time period: $PERIOD. Defaulting to week." 1>&2
        PERIOD="week"
        ;;
esac

SINCE_DATE=`date --date="1 $PERIOD ago" +"%F %T"`

MAIN_DISK=$(readlink -f "/dev/disk/by-uuid/{PART_UUID}") # <1>

echo "Subject: System Summary Report ($PERIOD)"
echo ""
echo "Report Period:    $PERIOD"
echo "Report Generated: $(date)"
echo "Uptime:          $(uptime)"
echo "Memory Usage:     RAM: $(free -m | grep Mem | awk '{print $3/$2 * 100}')%, Swap: $(free -m | grep Swap | awk '{print $3/$2 * 100}')%"
echo "Disk (main):      Temp: $(hddtemp -n SATA:"$MAIN_DISK"), Health: $(smartctl -H "$MAIN_DISK" | grep overall-health | sed 's/^.\+:\s\+//')"

echo "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
df -h

echo "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
echo "Temperatures:"
sensors -A

echo "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
echo "Top CPU:"
ps -eo pid,user,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort=-%cpu | head

echo "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
echo "Top RAM:"
ps -eo pid,user,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort=-%mem | head

echo "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
echo "SSH logins during this $PERIOD:"
last -s "$SINCE_DATE"

echo "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
echo "Last user logins:"
lastlog | grep -iv "Never logged in"

echo "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
echo "Logged errors:"
journalctl --since "$SINCE_DATE" -p err --no-pager

<1> Replace `\{PART_UUID}` with UUID of your `/boot` partition (can be copied from the `/etc/fstab` file).

NOTE: When this script is called without arguments it will generate weekly summary.
It can also be called with an argument, such as: `day`, `week` or `month`, to generate summary for the specific period.

Save this file as `/usr/local/sbin/system-summary.sh` and mark is as executable:

----
sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/sbin/system-summary.sh
----

To verify that it works do `sudo system-summary.sh` and check the output.

==== Email Delivery
To send emails the `ssmtp` program is used.
This is extremely lightweight tool with minimum dependencies, that sends mail to a configured mail server.

NOTE: Since `ssmtp` is not an actual mail server (or MTA), you will need some SMTP server to send mail.
You can use one provided by your ISP or any of free ones; however, the security and privacy of such setup is
at best - questionable. This is why `ssmtp` only used in this guide for non-sensitive mail, such as monitoring
emails and system status emails.

To install `ssmtp` do:

----
sudo apt install ssmtp
----

Edit the `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf` file, set `root` option to your desired email address,
`mailhub` to your SMTP server address and enable the use of TLS and STARTTLS:

./etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
[subs="attributes+"]
----
root={SB_EMAIL} # <1>

mailhub={SB_SMTP_ADDR}:{SB_SMTP_PORT} # <2>

UseTLS=Yes
UseSTARTTLS=Yes
----
<1> This email address will receive all mail for UIDs < 1000.
<2> Set this to your SMTP server address and port.

There are other parameters that may need to be configured (for example, if your SMTP server requires authentication).
The Arch Wiki article on `ssmtp` is a good source of information on this topic -
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSMTP.

To test that email delivery works try: `echo "test" | ssmtp root`.

NOTE: If this command is successful but email is not delivered, it was probably filtered.
You can run `ssmtp` with `-v` argument to get more verbose output, but I found no good solution to troubleshoot
filtering issues. Sometimes changing sender address, subject, content and hostname helps to avoid filtering.

As root user, create `/etc/systemd/system/system-summary-report.service` file with the following content:

./etc/systemd/system/system-summary-report.service
[subs="attributes+"]
----
[Unit]
Description=Email system summary report
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/usr/local/sbin/system-summary.sh | ssmtp root'
----

You can run this service manually and verify that you get the email:

----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start system-summary-report.service
----

As root user, create `/etc/systemd/system/system-summary-report.timer` file with the following content:

./etc/systemd/system/system-summary-report.timer
----
[Unit]
Description=Email system summary report

[Timer]
OnCalendar=Fri 18:00 # <1>
AccuracySec=1h
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
----
<1> Adjust this as needed, especially if using period other than week.

Enable and start the timer:

----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable system-summary-report.timer
sudo systemctl start system-summary-report.timer
----

To check timer status and time until next activation use:

----
sudo systemctl list-timers
----
