=== Login Notification
If you want to get an email notification for each login to the server,
create the `/usr/local/sbin/login-notify.sh` file with the following content:

./usr/local/sbin/login-notify.sh
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
TRUSTED_HOSTS="" # <1>

[ "$PAM_TYPE" = "open_session" ] || exit 0

for i in $TRUSTED_HOSTS; do
    if [ "$i" = "$PAM_RHOST" ]; then
        exit 0
    fi
done

MSG="Subject: Login Notification\n\n\
Date: `date`\n\
User: $PAM_USER\n\
Ruser: $PAM_RUSER\n\
Rhost: $PAM_RHOST\n\
Service: $PAM_SERVICE\n\
TTY: $PAM_TTY\n"

echo "$MSG" | ssmtp root
----
<1> You can set `TRUSTED_HOSTS` variable to a space-delimited list of addresses
for logins from which you don't want to generate notifications.

Mark this file as executable:

----
sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/sbin/login-notify.sh
----

Edit the `/etc/pam.d/common-session` file and append the following line to it:

./etc/pam.d/common-session
----
session    optional     pam_exec.so /usr/local/sbin/login-notify.sh
----

For some reason, the `common-session` file is not included in `/etc/pam.d/sudo`
(even though the relevant Debian bug was closed footnote:[https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519700]).
So if you also want to get notifications for `sudo` command, you will need to append the same line
to the `/etc/pam.d/sudo` file as well.
