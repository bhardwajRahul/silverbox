== Git Server
This section describes how to configure the server to host some private Git repositories.

Having your own private Git repositories can be very helpful for keeping configuration files organized,
notes, personal projects or forks that you prefer to keep private.
Keeping your Git repositories locally on the server (as opposed to cloud services such as Github or Gitlab)
has an advantage of being able to access them even when the cloud service or the internet connection is down.
Server backups (described in section <<backup>>) can be utilized for backing up Git repositories.
